# AI Coder Assistant Configuration

## Project Overview
This Python-based blog content generation system is designed to provide a clean, efficient, and maintainable codebase for a professional blogging platform.
AI Coder Assistant will assist in refactoring and implementing features according to specifications given by the user.

## System Instructions

### Refactoring Principles
- Follow PEP 8 styling guidelines for all Python code
- Implement proper error handling with descriptive error messages
- Maintain separation of concerns (presentation, business logic, data access)
- Use type hints consistently throughout the codebase
- Document all functions, classes, and modules with docstrings
- Implement comprehensive unit tests for all components

### Code Structure
- Organize code into appropriate modules and packages
- Use dependency injection where beneficial
- Implement proper configuration management

## Task Management
AI Coder Assistant will:
1. Read and analyze the TODO.md file to understand required tasks
2. Refactor existing code according to the principles above
3. Implement new features as specified
4. Document progress by updating the TODO.md file
5. Highlight any potential issues or suggest improvements

## Continuation Protocol
If the session is disconnected:
1. AI Coder Assistant will document completed work in TODO.md
2. Track progress on current tasks
3. List pending tasks with priority indicators
4. Provide context for seamless continuation in the next session


This configuration file serves as a guide for AI Coder Assistant to maintain professional standards while implementing and refactoring the Python blog system.
